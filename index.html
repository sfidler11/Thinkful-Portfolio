          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>My first introduction to coding and web design was during an introductory computer science course I took as a sophomore in college. This course was one of the most challenging and rewarding courses I took, and the "bug" (pun intended) to code stuck with me throughout my career as an educator. Now I am looking to transfer my passion for education to web design.</p>

          <p>I am currently a student at the Thinkful Software Engineering program and am looking forward to developing websites in the future.
           </p>

          <p> If you are looking for a web developer or want to chat, please do not hesitate to reach out! I am always looking to work with new people. </p>
          <p> Outside of software engineering, I like to:
